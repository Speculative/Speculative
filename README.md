    They call me Jeff. I'm currently a ðŸŽ“ PhD Student at the University of Pennsylvania.
    I used to be a Senior Software Engineer for MongoDB and Microsoft.
    I'm a full-stack developer who's worked on React-based UI, client/server data synchronization,
    notifications and alerting infrastructure, and tools to make other developers more effective.

    I like to imagine how computers could be better for people.
    I love to learn about technologies, topics across computing, and how we use computers.
    In my spare time, I like to create software projects that I wish existed in the world.
    I think it's important to be a human.
